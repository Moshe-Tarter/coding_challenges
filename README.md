# coding_challenges
solutions to coding interview questions and challenges, although public this repo is meant for personal use but if it helps anyone that is awsome.
The questions are mostly from "leetcode" and the "daily coding problem" email list.

* I can not guarantee the solutions are correct and/or optimal, i did not draft the questions just the solutions.

* This project requires Poetry as a dependency.
